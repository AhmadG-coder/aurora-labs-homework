Hi Aurora labs, in order to run the containers:
run the command sent in the e-mail

##### jenkins credentials: ###
- username: admin
- password: password (#CyberSecurity)


### requirements: ###
for running setup script:
- sudo apt-get install jq 


### Disclaimers: ###
- the string sent in the E-mail is the access token couldnt wrap a proper solution, issue: \
if the github access token is committed to the repository, it's deleted \
so full cmd cant be sent here since it will contain the access token
